# Overview

This documentation describes monitoring dashboards, their metrics, Zabbix alarms and Prometheus alerts.

The dashboards provide the following parameters to configure at the top of the dashboard:

* Interval time for metric display
* Node name

For all graph panels, the mean metric value is used in the given interval. For all singlestat panels,
the last metric value is used.
