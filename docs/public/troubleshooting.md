## Cluster Health

### Description

OpenSearch provides a default metric that indicates cluster state. It is called **cluster health**. To check the health of the cluster, the cluster health API can be used.

For more information on the cluster health API, refer to the official OpenSearch documentation, _Cluster Health_ [https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/cluster-health](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/cluster-health).

### Alerts

### How to solve

Not applicable

### Recommendations

To check the health of the cluster, the following API can be used:

```sh
curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
```

## Cluster Status

### Description

Cluster status is a custom metric that can be found on the **Cluster status** panel in Grafana. Possible values for cluster status are:

* `UP` - Cluster health status is GREEN and all nodes working.
* `DEGRADED` - Cluster has YELLOW health status or one node is failed.
* `FAILED` - Cluster has RED health status.

## Cluster Status is N/A

### Description

**N/A** status while monitoring indicates that the OpenSearch cluster is unreachable.

The main cause is any of the following:

* The cluster is down.
* The monitoring agent is not deployed.
* The monitoring agent is down.

### Alerts

* [OpenSearchIsDownAlert](./alerts.md#opensearchisdownalert)

### Stack trace

Not applicable

### How to solve

To resolve the issue, navigate to the OpenShift console and check the service state.

### Recommendations

In the simplest scenario, starting the service solves the issue. In the event of a permanent failure, try to redeploy the cluster or recover it from the backup.

## Cluster Status is Failed or Degraded

### Description

`Failed` status indicates that one or more primary shards is not allocated in the cluster. `Degraded` status means that one or more replica shards is missing.

This can happen when a node drops off the cluster for some reason. This could be due to disk failure, lack of memory or CPU, long garbage collection time, availability zone outage, and so on.

To check the health of the cluster, use the following API:

```sh
curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
```

### Alerts

* [OpenSearchIsDownAlert](./alerts.md#opensearchisdownalert)
* [OpenSearchIsDegradedAlert](./alerts.md#opensearchisdegradedalert)

### Stack trace

Not applicable

### How to solve

To identify the reason for the node failure, check the monitoring dashboard for any unusual changes that may have occurred around the same time the node failed.
When the problem is localized, go to the appropriate problem description and follow the relevant troubleshooting procedure to fix it.

After the node is fixed, its shards remain in an initializing state before they transition back to active status.
During this initialization period, the cluster state may change from `up` to `degraded` or `failed` until the shards on the recovering node regain active status.
In many cases, a brief status change to `degraded` or `failed` may not require any additional actions.

If it is a permanent failure, and the node cannot be recovered, new nodes can be added, after which OpenSearch recovers data from any available replica shards.
Replica shards can be promoted to primary shards and redistributed on the new nodes.

### Recommendations

For more information on OpenSearch clusters, refer to the official OpenSearch documentation [https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/cluster-health].

The following scenarios are examples of permanent failures:

* [Disk failure on one node](scenarios/disk_failure_on_one_node.md)
* [Disk failure on all nodes](scenarios/disk_failure_on_all_nodes.md)

If both the primary and replica copy of a shard are lost, data can be recovered from backup.

## Last Backup Has Failed

### Description

The last OpenSearch backup has finished with `Failed` status.

```

### How to solve

If all data nodes are running low on disk space, more data nodes should be added to the cluster.

### Recommendations

Be sure that all indices have enough primary shards to be able to balance their data across all those nodes.
However, if only some nodes are running out of disk space, this is usually a sign that an index was initialized with too few shards.
If an index is composed of a few very large shards, it is hard for OpenSearch to distribute these shards across nodes in a balanced manner.

For more information, refer to [Disk Filled on All Nodes](scenarios/disk_filled_on_all_nodes.md).

## Lack of Resources

### Description

Some problems with the OpenSearch cluster can occur due to a lack of CPU, memory, and disk resources.

## OpenSearch Fails Down with CircuitBreakingException

### Description

OpenSearch includes a special circuit breaker that is intended to prevent `OutOfMemoryException`.
The circuit breaker estimates the memory requirements of a query by inspecting the fields involved.
It then checks to see whether loading the field data required would push the total field data size over the configured percentage of the heap.
If the estimated query size is larger than the limit, then the circuit breaker is tripped, and the query will be aborted and return an exception.

Both `GET` and `PUT` requests are failed.

The main reasons for this failure are as follows:

* Query tries to load more data than memory is currently available.
* Index is bigger than available heap.
* Continuous shard relocation due to the data nodes being out of space.

### Recommendations

For more details and troubleshooting procedures,refer to [Entire Index Corrupted](scenarios/entire_index_corrupted.md).

## Translog Corrupted

### Description

To prevent data loss, each shard has a transaction log, or translog, associated with it. If a shard is failed, the most recent transactions can be replayed from the transaction log when the shard recovers.
In some cases (such as a bad drive or user error), the translog can become corrupted.
When this corruption is detected by OpenSearch due to mismatching checksums, OpenSearch will fail the shard and refuse to allocate that copy of the data to the node,
recovering from a replica if available.

If a translog was corrupted, the shards with a corrupted translog will have `TranslogCorruptedException` in `unassigned.details`.

```

### How to solve

If `index.translog.durability` is set to `async`, fsync and commit in the background every sync\_interval.
In the event of a hardware failure, all acknowledged writes since the last automatic commit will be discarded.

When this corruption is detected by OpenSearch due to mismatching checksums, OpenSearch will fail the shard and refuse to allocate that copy of the data to the node,
recovering from a replica if available.

If there is no copy of the data from which OpenSearch can recover successfully, you may want to recover the data that is part of the shard at the cost of losing the data that is currently
contained in the translog. OpenSearch provides a command-line tool for this: `opensearch-translog`.

## Problem During Replication

### Description

Data replication in OpenSearch is based on the primary-backup model. This model assumes a single authoritative copy of the data, called the primary.
All indexing operations first go to the primary, which is then in charge of replicating changes to active backup copies, called replica shards.
OpenSearch uses replica shards to provide failover capabilities, as well as to scale out reads.

```

### How to solve

When a major disaster strikes, there may be situations where only stale shard copies are available in the cluster.
OpenSearch will not automatically allocate such shard copies as primary shards, and the cluster will stay red.
In a case where all in-sync shard copies are gone for good, however, there is still a possibility for the cluster to revert to using stale copies,
but this requires manual intervention from the cluster administrator.

### Recommendations

For more details and troubleshooting procedures,refer to [Problem During Replication](scenarios/problem_during_replication.md).

## Primary Shard Is Down During User Request

### Description

Data can be lost if OpenSearch node is down during user request.
However, OpenSearch provides tools to prevent data loss, including a translog, or transaction log, which records every operation in OpenSearch as it happens.

### Alerts

Not applicable

### Stack trace

Not applicable

### How to solve

OpenSearch provides the capability to subdivide your index into multiple pieces called shards. When you create an index, you can simply define the number of shards that you want.
Each shard is in itself a fully-functional and independent "index" that can be hosted on any node in the cluster.

In a network or cloud environment where failures can be expected anytime, it is very useful and highly recommended having a failover mechanism in case a shard or node somehow goes offline or
disappears for whatever reason. Therefore, OpenSearch enables you to make one or more copies of your indexâ€™s shards into what are called replica shards, replicas for short.

### Recommendations

For more details and troubleshooting procedures,refer to [Primary Shard Is Down During User Request](scenarios/primary_shard_is_down_during_user_request.md).

## Container Failed with Error: container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as root

### Description

The Operator is deployed successfully and operator logs do not contain errors, but OpenSearch Monitoring, OpenSearch Curator and/or DBaaS OpenSearch adapter pods fail.

OpenSearch Monitoring, OpenSearch Curator and DBaaS OpenSearch adapter do not have special user to run processes, so default (`root`) user is used.
If you miss the `securityContext` parameter in the pod configuration and `Pod Security Policy` is enabled, the default `securityContext` for pod is taken from `Pod Security Policy`.

If the `Pod Security Policy` is configured as follows then the error mentioned above occurs:

```yaml
runAsUser:
   # Require the container to run without root privileges.
   rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
```

### Alerts

### How to solve

The solution is to re-generate internal TLS certificates with long-lived duration.

The most right solution is to upgrade OpenSearch to one of the following stable versions to generate them automatically:

* [0.2.13](https://github.com/Netcracker/opensearch-service/-/tags/0.2.13)
* [0.3.7](https://github.com/Netcracker/opensearch-service/-/tags/0.3.7)
* [1.3.2](https://github.com/Netcracker/opensearch-service/-/tags/1.3.2)

If upgrade is not possible and manual fix is required, please follow steps:

1. Manually remove secrets "opensearch-admin-certs" and "opensearch-transport-certs"
   (and "opensearch-rest-certs" if presented) from the OpenSearch namespace.
2. Edit the template of [opensearch-tls-reinit.yaml](/docs/data/opensearch-tls-reinit.yaml) resources and specify corresponding
   namespace and OpenSearch docker image (you can take it from working pods) if required.
3. Apply result template with command `kubectl apply -f opensearch-tls-reinit.yaml` to the namespace with OpenSearch.
4. Wait until Job execution. There should be `'admin' certificates are generated` output inside.
5. Restart OpenSearch pods.
6. Remove created Job with the command `kubectl delete -f opensearch-tls-reinit.yaml` from the namespace with OpenSearch.
   **Solution**:

### Recommendations

This problem can be beforehand diagnosed with executing the following command that displays expiration time of current certificate:

```text
openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in /usr/share/opensearch/config/transport-crt.pem
```

Pay attention, this problem and provided solutions below are applicable only for disabled TLS deployment (`global.tls.enabled: false`), when only internal connections are under TLS. 
Otherwise, you have to regenerate TLS certificates with specified way (`CertManager` or manual certificates).

## OpenSearch Clients Fail with Authentication Error

### Description

DBaaS created users cannot login to OpenSearch and fails with authentication error.

DBaaS user was not correctly created on the OpenSearch side while DBaaS thought it was.
To check the real state of OpenSearch users you can reach the endpoint `{opensearch_host}/_plugins/_security/api/internalusers/`
with OpenSearch admin credentials and check the necessary DBaaS service user there.

```

### How to solve

  To resolve desynchronization of DBaaS database and OpenSearch users storage you can use the rollowing DBaaS restore api:

```bash
curl -u cluster-dba:{dbaas_password} -XPOST -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" http://dbaas-aggregator.dbaas:8080/api/v3/dbaas/internal/physical_databases/users/restore-password -d '
{
    "physicalDbId": "{OPENSEARCH-NAMESPACE}",
    "type": "opensearch",
    "settings": {}
}'
```

Then wait some time until users being synchronized.

### Recommendations

There can be a lot of causes of that desynchronization and you need to contact support with your case and provide logs from DBaaS Adapter.

### Alerts

* [OpenSearchDBaaS](./alerts.md#opensearchdbaasisdownalert)

### Stack trace

### How to solve

Navigate to the OpenSearch console on `standby` side and run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -u <username>:<password> -XGET http://opensearch.<opensearch_namespace>:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,health&v
   ```

   where:

   * `<username>:<password>` are the credentials to OpenSearch.
   * `<opensearch_namespace>` is the namespace where `standby` side of OpenSearch is located. For example, `opensearch-service`.

   The result can be as follows:

   ```

  Make sure that all indices required for replication have `green` health status.

Navigate to the OpenSearch console on `standby` side and execute the following:

   ```bash
   curl -u username:password http://opensearch.<opensearch_namespace>:9200/_plugins/_replication/autofollow_stats
   ```

   where `opensearch.<opensearch_namespace>` are service name and namespace for OpenSearch on the `standby` side.

   The result can be as follows:

   ```json
   {
       "num_success_start_replication": 2,
       "num_failed_start_replication": 1,
       "num_failed_leader_calls": 0,
       "failed_indices": ["test_topic"],
       "autofollow_stats": [
           {
               "name": "dr-replication",
               "pattern": "*",
               "num_success_start_replication": 3,
               "num_failed_start_replication": 0,
               "num_failed_leader_calls": 0,
               "failed_indices": ["test_topic"]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Recognize the list of `failed_indices`.

For each index from the previous step do the following:

   1. Navigate to the OpenSearch console on the `active` side and try to stop replication for the index:

      ```bash
      curl -u <username>:<password> -XPOST http://opensearch.<opensearch_namespace>:9200/_plugins/_replication/<index_name>/_stop -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{}'
      ```

      where:
      * `<username>:<password>` are the credentials to OpenSearch.
      * `opensearch.<opensearch_namespace>` are service name and namespace for OpenSearch on the active side.
      * `<index_name>` is the name of failed index. For example, `test_topic`.

      This is an asynchronous operation and expected response is the following:

      ```json
      {"acknowledged": true}
      ```

   2. If on the previous step you have got the following response:

      ```json
      {"error":{"root_cause":[{"type":"illegal_argument_exception","reason":"No replication in progress for index:test_topic"}],"type":"illegal_argument_exception","reason":"No replication in progress for index:test_topic"},"status":400}
      ```

      The replication is not run on the `active` side for the specified failed `test_topic` index.
      Then you need to go to the `standby` side of OpenSearch cluster and check the status of replication for above index:

      ```bash
      curl -u <username>:<password> -XGET http://opensearch.<opensearch_namespace>:9200/_plugins/_replication/<index_name>/_status?pretty
      ```

      Where:
      * `<username>:<password>` are the credentials to OpenSearch.
      * `<opensearch_namespace>` is the namespace where `standby` side of OpenSearch is located. For example, `opensearch-service`.
      * `<index_name>` is the name of failed index. For example, `test_topic`.

   3. If `status` of index replication on `standby` side is `FAILED`, you have to stop corresponding replication with the following command:

      ```bash
      curl -u <username>:<password> -XPOST  http://opensearch.<opensearch_namespace>:9200/_plugins/_replication/<index_name>/_stop -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{}'
      ```

      Where:
      * `<username>:<password>` are the credentials to OpenSearch.
      * `<opensearch_namespace>` is the namespace where `standby` side of OpenSearch is located. For example, `opensearch-service`.
      * `<index_name>` is the name of failed index. For example, `test_topic`.

For `standby` side switch OpenSearch cluster to the `active` side and return to the `standby` one. This action should restart replication properly.

### How to solve

1. Scale down all pods related to OpenSearch (`master`, `data`, `ingest`, `arbiter`) on the `standby` side.
2. Clear the OpenSearch data on the `standby` side in one of the following ways:
   * Remove OpenSearch persistent volumes.
   * Clear persistent volumes manually.
3. Scale up all pods related to OpenSearch (`master`, `data`, `ingest`, `arbiter`) on the `standby` side.

**Note**: It is safe as you need to perform these steps on the `standby` side. All the data is replicated from the `active` side once the replication process has started successfully.

### Stack trace

Not applicable

### How to solve

1. Navigate to the OpenSearch console on `standby` side and run the following command:

      ```bash
      curl -u <username>:<password> -XGET http://opensearch.<opensearch_namespace>:9200/_plugins/_replication/<index_name>/_status?pretty
      ```

   Where:
   * `<username>:<password>` are the credentials to OpenSearch.
   * `<opensearch_namespace>` is the namespace where `standby` side of OpenSearch is located. For example, `opensearch-service`.
   * `<index_name>` is the name of missed index. For example, `test_topic`.

   The following response makes it clear that index was removed in active side:

   ```json
   {"status":"PAUSED","reason":"AutoPaused: [[haindex2][0] - org.opensearch.index.IndexNotFoundException - \"no such index [haindex2]\"], ","leader_alias":"leader-cluster","leader_index":"haindex2","follower_index":"haindex2"}
   ```

2. To run the replication again, you can remove presented index on standby side:

   ```bash
   curl -u <username>:<password> -XDELETE http://opensearch.<opensearch_namespace>:9200/<index_name>
   ```

   Where:
   * `<username>:<password>` are the credentials to OpenSearch.
   * `<opensearch_namespace>` is the namespace where `standby` side of OpenSearch is located. For example, `opensearch-service`.
   * `<index_name>` is the name of missed index. For example, `test_topic`.

   Then wait some time for `autofollow` process run replication again.

### Recommendations

This option cleans all index data presented on the standby side. Make sure to remove this and check whether OpenSearch on the active side has correct changes.
