### OpenSearch cluster

![Dashboard](/docs/public/images/opensearch-monitoring_cluster_overview.png)

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Name | Description | Thresholds | Repeat |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Cluster status | Status of OpenSearch cluster.<br/>If the cluster status is `degraded`, at least one replica shard is unallocated or missing. The search<br/>   results will still be complete, but if more shards are missing, you may lose data.<br/>   <br/>   A `failed` cluster status indicates that:<br/>   <br/>    * At least one primary shard is missing.<br/>    * You are missing data.<br/>    * The searches will return partial results.<br/>    * You will be blocked from indexing into that shard. |  |  |
| Nodes status | Status of OpenSearch nodes |  |  |
| CPU Usage | Maximum current CPU usage (in percent) among all OpenSearch servers. |  |  |
| JVM Heap Usage | Maximum current usage JVM heap memory (in percent) among all OpenSearch servers. |  |  |
| Off-Heap Memory Usage | The maximum memory usage excluding allocated JVM Heap memory (in percent) among all OpenSearch servers.<br/>This amount of memory is used by operating system and Apache Lucene. |  |  |
| Cluster Status Transitions | Transitions of OpenSearch cluster status |  |  |
| Pod Readiness Probe Transitions | Transitions of readiness probes for each OpenSearch pod. |  |  |

### OpenSearch shards

![Dashboard](/docs/public/images/opensearch-monitoring_opensearch_shards.png)

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Name | Description | Thresholds | Repeat |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Active primary shards | The number of active primary shards in OpenSearch cluster | Default:<br/>Mode: absolute<br/>Level 1: 80<br/><br/> |  |
| Active shards | The number of active primary and replica shards in OpenSearch cluster | Default:<br/>Mode: absolute<br/>Level 1: 80<br/><br/> |  |
| Initializing shards | The number of shards that are in the `initializing` state. When you first create an index, or when a node is rebooted, its shards are briefly in the `initializing` state before transitioning to `started` or `unassigned` as the master node attempts to assign shards to nodes in the cluster. If you see the shards remain in the `initializing` state for too long, it could be a warning sign that your cluster is unstable. | Default:<br/>Mode: absolute<br/>Level 1: 80<br/><br/> |  |
| Relocating shards | The number of shards that are relocating now and have the `relocating` state. | Default:<br/>Mode: absolute<br/>Level 1: 80<br/><br/> |  |
| Unassigned shards | The number of shards that are not assigned to any node and have the `unassigned` state. If you see the shards remain in the `unassigned` state for too long, it could be a warning sign that your cluster is unstable. | Default:<br/>Mode: absolute<br/>Level 1: 80<br/><br/> |  |

### OpenSearch tasks

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Name | Description | Thresholds | Repeat |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Pending Tasks | The number of tasks in 'pending' status in OpenSearch cluster | Default:<br/>Mode: absolute<br/>Level 1: 1<br/>Level 2: 5<br/><br/> |  |

### Network metrics

![Dashboard](/docs/public/images/opensearch-monitoring_network_metrics.png)

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Name | Description | Thresholds | Repeat |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Open transport connections | The number of open transport connections for each OpenSearch node. May be not applicable for managed external OpenSearch. |  |  |
| Open http connections | The number of open HTTP connections for each OpenSearch node. If the total number of open HTTP connections is constantly increasing, it may indicate that your HTTP clients are not properly establishing persistent connections. Reestablishing connections adds extra milliseconds or even seconds to your request response time. |  |  |
| Transport size | The rate of change between subsequent size values of received (rx) and transmitted (tx) packages for each OpenSearch node. May be not applicable for managed external OpenSearch. |  |  |

### JVM heap and GC metrics

![Dashboard](/docs/public/images/opensearch-monitoring_jvm_heap_and_gc_metrics.png)

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Name | Description | Thresholds | Repeat |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |
| JVM heap usage | The usage of JVM heap memory by each OpenSearch node |  |  |
| JVM heap usage percent | OpenSearch is set up to initiate garbage collections whenever JVM heap usage hits 75 percent. As shown above, it may be useful to monitor which nodes exhibit high heap usage, and set up an alert to find out if any node is consistently using over 85 percent of heap memory; this indicates that the rate of garbage collection isn�t keeping up with the rate of garbage creation. To address this problem, you can either increase your heap size (as long as it remains below the recommended guidelines stated above), or scale out the cluster by adding more nodes. |  |  |
| JVM non heap usage | The usage of memory outside the JVM heap by each OpenSearch node |  |  |
| GC time | Time spent on major GCs that collect old generation objects and on minor GCs that collects young generation objects in JVM (time rate per sampling interval). |  |  |

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Name | Description | Thresholds | Repeat |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |
| OS memory usage | The usage of memory by each OpenSearch node and its limit. These metric is useful to avoid reaching the memory limit on nodes. |  |  |
| Off-heap memory usage | The usage of memory excluding allocated JVM Heap memory by each OpenSearch node and its limit. <br/>  This amount of memory is used by operating system and Apache Lucene. |  |  |

### Thread pool queues and requests metrics

![Dashboard](/docs/public/images/opensearch-monitoring_thread_pool_queues_and_requests_metrics.png)

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Name | Description | Thresholds | Repeat |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Requests latency | If you notice the indexing latency increasing, you may be trying to index too many documents at one time (OpenSearch�s documentation recommends starting with a bulk indexing size of 5 to 15 megabytes and increasing slowly from there).<br/>If you are planning to index a lot of documents and you don�t need the new information to be immediately available for search, you can optimize for indexing performance over search performance by decreasing refresh frequency until you are done indexing.<br/>Flush latency:  If you see this metric increasing steadily, it could indicate a problem with slow disks |  |  |
| Rejected requests | The size of each thread pool�s queue represents how many requests are waiting to be served while the node is currently at capacity. The queue allows the node to track and eventually serve these requests instead of discarding them. Thread pool rejections arise once the thread pool�s maximum queue size (which varies based on the type of thread pool) is reached. |  |  |
| Thread pool queues | The size of each thread pool�s queue represents how many requests are waiting to be served while the node is currently at capacity. |  |  |
