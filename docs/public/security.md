## Disabling User Accounts

OpenSearch does not support disabling user accounts.

## Password Policies

* Passwords must be at least 8 characters long. This ensures a basic level of complexity and security.
* The passwords can contain only the following symbols:
    * Alphabets: a-zA-Z
    * Numerals: 0-9
    * Punctuation marks: ., ;, !, ?
    * Mathematical symbols: -, +, *, /, %
    * Brackets: (, ), {, }, <, >
    * Additional symbols: _, |, &, @, $, ^, #, ~

**Note**: To ensure that passwords are sufficiently complex, it is recommended to include:

* A minimum length of 8 characters
* At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
* At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
* At least one numeral (0-9)
* At least one special character from the allowed symbols list

## Changing password guide

Password changing procedures for OpenSearch cluster is described in respective guide:

* [Password changing guide](/docs/public/password-changing.md)

# General Consideration

OpenSearch has its own security plugin for authentication and access control. The plugin provides numerous features to help you secure your cluster.
You can find information about security in official documentation [OpenSearch Security](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security-plugin/index/).

**Note:** Initial security configurations like username and password or OpenID URL cannot be changed with rolling upgrade.
Corresponding REST API or Dashboards should be used for this purpose.

# Logging

Security events and critical operations should be logged for audit purposes. You can find more details about enabling 
audit logging in [Audit Guide](/docs/public/audit.md).
